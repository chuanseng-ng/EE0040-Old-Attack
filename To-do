Simulate:
  Redo/refine digital logic circuit simulator to be able to produce correct outputs for specific inputs at least 90% of the time
  (Regardless of number of logic gates present in netlist) (Completed [2/1/2020])

Camouflage:
  Remove output corruptibility re-calculator function
  If multiple gates are needed to be chosen, choose next best in list (Completed [8/12/2019]) {Camouflage_Simple}
  Refine format
  
Attack:
  Remove pre-determined pattern and add user-based selection for camouflaged gate pattern (Completed [8/12/2019])
  Refine format
