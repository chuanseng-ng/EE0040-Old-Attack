### EE0040 Design Automation for Camouflage Circuits (Old Attack)

This set of algorithm is mainly used as an archive and benchmark for the full iteration attack algorithm <br/>
The current attack algorithm, elimination, can be seen [here](https://github.com/waelectriz/EE0040-Design-Automation-for-Camouflage-Circuits "Elimination Method") <br/>
